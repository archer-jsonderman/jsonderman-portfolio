title: About Me 
---

I improve users’ lives… through user experience research and principles. For the last 6 years, this focus has been on the higher education seeker looking for online degree opportunities and the medical professional looking to understand the new digital world of caring for people.

I solve problems… by bringing creative leadership and experience to projects through user-centered design and design thinking practices. I relentlessly collaborate and explore, inviting all who want to join in the discovery.

I grow leaders… through servant leadership practices, I have united and grown teams on the opposite sides of the globe. I have made space for my team to take up leadership roles. Together, we have launched more than 30 websites, 40 landing pages, and 2 large-scale learning platforms.
