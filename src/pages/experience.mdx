The two pillars of my role at BetterCloud are the consistency of experience and the maturation of the uplift strategy for the platform. It places me in the space between design, product, and engineering to ensure that our users are being served with the best experiences to get things done.

My primary responsibilities are:
- Develop deep partnerships with leaders in Product and Engineering to solve problems collaboratively
- Guide and mentor other product designers to grow and align with the high-level strategy for the business
- Oversee and optimize the information architecture to promote usefulness and performance
- Mature and socialize an evolutionary UX strategy that advances the overall experience
- Develop journey maps, information architectures, and wireframes to articulate the UX strategy
- Maintain a Figma component library that is an analog to our React component library ensuring consistency across multiple products

The primary achievements at BetterCloud are:
- Established a centralized design system in partnership with Front-end Engineering to allow rapid delivery of experiences in our platform. This system responds to the needs of Product Designers and Engineers by providing templates for successful experiences while evolving to include new needs for our experiences.
- Built a strong relationship with the SCRUM teams to include design as part of their teams, as well as be part of product team leadership engagements.
